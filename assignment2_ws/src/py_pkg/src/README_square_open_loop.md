To create an open loop controlled square path followed by the turtlebot in turtlesim environment, straightline movement and rotation of the turtle was considered
The code allows to define some parameters and asks user for an input of desired distance to be followed by a robot with the angle of rotation after the desired distance is achieved
Distance is calculated based on the time data and linear velocity available with us to give the robot a stop command to follow next step
Similar to the distance, angular rotation is calculated based on angular velocity and the time
As observed, To achieve a near perfect square path the linear velocity of the turtle should be low
