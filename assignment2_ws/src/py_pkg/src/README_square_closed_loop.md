Go to goal is used as a reference to create a closed loop controlller for turtlebot to follow a square path
Proportional controller is implemented which consider the speed and distance based on the previous input
velocity will be larger when the distance is more and vice versa
Coordinates of the desired square are input in the function for turtle to follow the path
Near perfect square was achieved by iterating the linear velocity and angular velocity input values to avoid the overshooting  and spinningof the turtlebot
